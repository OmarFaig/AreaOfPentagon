# ExercisesJava
// Here I want to add some of Java exercises that I solved during my Java courses . First one is calculation an area of pectagon . Here the program prompts the user to enter the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex and computes the area of pentagon.

At the end the area is rounded up to 2 digits and that was the requirement of exercise.
